Hacky solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2021 written in javascript/ typescript

## How to use
To use any of the solutions, navigate to any of the folders an run the functions using  [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)
If you are trying to get the solution to your own puzzle, remeber to replace the string in the input file for each of the functions. Just paste it as is between the `` quotes.

## "You are violating the DRY principle!"
Yes, yes I am. Most of part 2s are just part 1s, copied in their entirety, with changes to accomodate restrictions of part 2. This, however, is by design. I like those solutions, to be self contained, for ease of future refrence for myself, or somebody visiting to look for clues on how to solve a problem on their own.
