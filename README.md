Now 350/350 :star: !

## How to use

To use any of the solutions, navigate to any of the folders an run the functions using [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)
If you are trying to get the solution to your own puzzle, remeber to replace the string in the input file for each of the functions. Just paste it as is between the `` quotes. Note: make sure that there is no newline after last "real" line, I've been told it sometimes bricks the solution.
